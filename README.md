# Web Development Challenge Projects

Here are some projects that progress in difficulty from the first high school project that is not yet valid html, to the Supernatural fan site (the most difficult at this point). Feel free to fork this repository and play with the source code yourself to see how small changes you make will change the output.

You'll want to get setup with Github pages on your own repo. Name it:

- yourusername.github.io

From here you can create an "index.html" file that links to your other project files.

These files will be online SO BE CAREFUL!

By putting them online, however, you'll be able to view your projects through the links and have fun with it. Feel free to make your own but MAKE SURE THEY ARE SCHOOL APPROPRIATE! CHECK WITH ME IF YOU'RE UNSURE. WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T PUT IT ONLINE!

Ideas could be:

- a simple blog
- a fan site
- a business website
- a portfolio site
- a news site
- etc.
